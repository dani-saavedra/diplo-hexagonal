## Creating an issue

### :bug: Bug Report:

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on Issues.
- If you couldn't find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.
- When opening a new bug related issue, follow our template.

- Remember to complete the following information otherwise your issue will be rejected:

    - Steps to reproduce
  > Let us know the steps required to trigger your bug
    - Expected Behavior
  > what were you expecting?
    - Actual Behavior
  > what happened instead ?

### :rocket: Feature Request/Enhancement:
- Make sure there's an issue for what you want to add.
- If there isn't an issue, open a new one.
- Whether willing to request a new feature or enhance an existing one, open a "feature request" issue.

>You can contact the team to get more information and/or help you develop your required feature, check our [contact channels](#contac-us)


## Coding Guidance

All contributors *MUST* follow the [Coding Guidelines](/CODING_GUIDELINES.md). Contributions that do not follow these
guidelines will not be taken into account until the necessary modifications are made.

## Request For Change / Feature Request

Generally speaking an RFC is needed when you want to add a new component or change an existing one in an incompatible
way that might result in a major version bump.

Though it seems a little bureaucratic, the process is in place in order to avoid frustration of a potential contributor
by making the discussions take place before any code is written. Once the design and direction is fully agreed then the
contributor can work peacefully knowing that their change will be committed.

As of this moment all you need to do is create an issue and use the
[Feature Request Template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

Please prepend your issue title with `[RFC]` so that's easier to filter.

## Bug Reports

Bugs are a reality in software. We can't fix what we don't know about, so please report liberally. If you're not sure if
something is a bug or not, feel free to file it anyway.

Before reporting a bug, please search existing issues and pull requests, as it's possible that someone else has already
reported your error. In the off case that you find your issue as fixed/closed, please add a reference to it on your new
one.

Your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant
information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for
yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Opening an issue is as easy as following
[this link](https://github.com/suproyecto/issues/new) and filling out the given template.

Bug reports may also be sent in the form of a [pull request](#pull-request) containing a failing test.

## Pull Request:

- Beware of the status resolution.
- Once approved, fork the project and branch out from master.
- Read and follow our [coding guidelines](/CODING_GUIDELINES.md)
- Work on your branch normally. Please make an effort to follow existing conventions and styles in order to keep the code as readable as possible.
- Micro commits are also recommended in order to follow our conventions.
- Include tests that cover critical paths of the modified code and make sure that those tests are green.
- Once finished, open a new pull request with the fix or feature.
- The PR should have a clear title. Description should tell us about the problem and solution.
- Remember refer open issues on the description.
- Assign or notify one of the maintainers.

---

If taking too much time to deliver code, **always** [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) towards `master`
before asking for a review, and avoid reverse merge commits. We **HATE** reverse merge commits (they make git history
tree a mess) and will reject contributions that have them.

## The issue life-cycle

- **Proposed:** Every issue starts with this status. The issue has fifteen days to be discussed by the team and moved to the next status.

- **Agreed:** This status means that we agree with your proposal. We will assign a reviewer to the issue.

- **Active:** Issues with this status are being developed.

- **Implemented:** The issue has its PR under review, approved or waiting to be deployed.

- **Postponed:** We agree with the proposal, but its development won't take place in a short-term future.

- **Rejected:** Low quality proposals, proposals that were previously-rejected or those that don't fit into a long-term roadmap might be quickly rejected.

## SLA

Bug Fixes: Are checked within 3 week days.

Enhancements: Are checked within 2 weeks.

Features: Are checked within 2 weeks.

> What do we mean when we say that an issue was checked?
> That the reviewer either agreed or rejected your proposal

## Trusted Committers
Trusted Committers (TCs) are those members of our working group who have elevated rights and direct write access to this repository.

> Trusted Committers act as stewards of the working group and community. They aim to make consensus-based decisions in the best interest of the working group.
They also act as the guardians of this repository: TCs react to, referee, and give feedback about incoming contributions.
For further information about the concept, also see the [Trusted Committer Pattern](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/2-structured/trusted-committer.md).
